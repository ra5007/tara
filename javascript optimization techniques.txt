1.Basically doctype will tell the browser use the this html version to render this page
 in the specified strict mode or standard mode(will render the code with the current specification)
 if you don't type the doctype the browser will render the page in quirk mode(which is a old mode with out standadization)

2.Meta tags provide the metadata about the html document.
 meta data willnot be displayed on the page.but it is mechine parsable
